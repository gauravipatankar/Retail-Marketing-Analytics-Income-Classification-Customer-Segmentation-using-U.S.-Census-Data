# Retail-Marketing-Analytics-Income-Classification-Customer-Segmentation-using-US-Census-Data  

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  
This project simulates a real-world data science project for a **retail client** seeking actionable marketing insights from population data.  
It consists of two major components:  

- **Income Classification Model** â€“ Predicts whether an individual earns **more or less than $50,000 per year** using 40 demographic and employment-related variables.  
- **Customer Segmentation Model** â€“ Performs **unsupervised clustering** to identify distinct socio-demographic segments and generate interpretable population personas for targeted marketing.  

Both analyses are built on **U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey (1994â€“1995)** data, demonstrating end-to-end handling of real-world, messy demographic data:  
**data cleaning â†’ feature engineering â†’ modeling â†’ evaluation â†’ insight generation.**
